## Description

Cart Progress Discount is a production-grade WordPress + WooCommerce plugin that shows a **global floating incentive bar** on all pages of your store. The bar displays how much more customers need to spend to unlock discounts, encouraging them to add more items to their cart.

### Features

✅ **Global Coverage** - Appears on all pages (home, shop, product, cart, checkout, blog)  
✅ **Automatic Discounts** - Applies discounts automatically at checkout  
✅ **Real-time Updates** - Updates instantly when cart changes  
✅ **No Theme Conflicts** - Fully isolated CSS and JavaScript  
✅ **Mobile Responsive** - Looks great on all devices  
✅ **No jQuery** - Pure vanilla JavaScript for best performance  
✅ **Accessibility Ready** - Follows WCAG guidelines  
✅ **Easy Configuration** - Simple PHP array to customize discount tiers

## Installation

1. Upload the `wc-cart-progress-discount` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure discount rules in the PHP file (see Configuration below)

---

## Configuration

Edit the discount rules in `wc-cart-progress-discount.php`:

```php
function wc_cpd_get_discount_rules(): array
{
    return [
        2000 => 5,   // ₹2000 → 5% discount
        3000 => 10,  // ₹3000 → 10% discount
    ];
}
```

Add or modify tiers as needed. Format: `amount => discount_percentage`

---

## How It Works

1. Customer adds items to cart
2. Floating bar appears at the top of the page showing:
   - "Add ₹XXX more to unlock X% OFF" (when working toward a discount)
   - Progress bar filling up
3. When discount threshold is reached:
   - Bar shows "🎉 You unlocked X% OFF"
   - Discount is automatically applied at checkout
4. Bar disappears when cart is empty
